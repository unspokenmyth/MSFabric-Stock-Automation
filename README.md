# Real-Time Stock Market Analytics Platform with Microsoft Fabric

This project is an end-to-end data pipeline built entirely within Microsoft Fabric. It ingests real-time stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, processes it through a Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and generates actionable trading insights.

## üìä Architecture & Data Flow

The pipeline is orchestrated within Microsoft Fabric to automate the data flow from raw ingestion to curated analytics.


*The high-level pipeline orchestration in Microsoft Fabric.*

The pipeline follows a multi-layered approach:

### 1. ü•â Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion
Raw, unaltered stock data is fetched from the **Alpha Vantage API**. A Fabric pipeline handles the orchestration, ingesting the time-series data and storing it in the `bronze_stock_data` Delta table.

### 2. ü•à Silver Layer: Cleansing and Feature Engineering
The `CalculateTechnicalIndicators.ipynb` notebook processes the raw data from the Bronze layer. It performs cleansing and calculates key technical indicators to enrich the dataset.

* **Calculations Include:**
    * Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    * Bollinger Bands
    * Volume Analysis
* **Output Table:** `silver_stock_analytics`

### 3. ü•á Gold Layer: Business Aggregation & Insights
The `GoldLayerAnalytics.ipynb` notebook consumes the enriched data from the Silver layer to generate high-level, business-ready insights. These aggregated tables are designed for direct use in analytics, reporting, or downstream applications.

* **Key Output Tables:**
    * `gold_trading_signals`: Generates BUY/SELL signals based on RSI and Bollinger Band movements.
    * `gold_stock_rankings`: Scores and ranks stocks based on momentum, volume, and technical strength.
    * `gold_hourly_patterns`: Analyzes intraday performance to identify the best-performing hours.
    * `gold_volatility_metrics`: Calculates daily volatility and price range percentages.
    * `gold_anomalies`: Detects unusual price or volume movements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Platform:** Microsoft Fabric
* **Data Processing:** Apache Spark (via PySpark notebooks)
* **Storage:** OneLake (Delta Lake format)
* **Data Source:** Alpha Vantage API

## üìì Repository Contents

* `CalculateTechnicalIndicators.ipynb`: The Spark notebook for transforming data from the Bronze to the Silver layer.
* `GoldLayerAnalytics.ipynb`: The Spark notebook for aggregating Silver data into the Gold layer for final analysis.
* `pipeline.json`: The JSON definition of the Microsoft Fabric pipeline, detailing all activities, connections, and configurations used for orchestration.
